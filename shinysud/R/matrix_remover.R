#' Matrix remover function
#' @description A Sudoku grid ready to be played based on the solution matrix generated.
#' The function clears some of the cases (replacing the numbers with NA), tests
#' the obtained grid with matrix_solver to make sure it has a unique solution
#' and is of the expected difficulty.
#' @param Matrix_m The solution matrix generated
#' @param Level The expected difficulty of the Sudoku
#' @return a 9x9 Matrix corresponding to a playable Sudoku grid
